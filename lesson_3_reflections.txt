When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Use a remote reposity to back up local device and to share with others or across devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is better to pull complete changes.  I may not want to share incomplete work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clone - duplicates entire repository
    branch - divergent commit(s) within one repository
    fork - separate repositories which may have divergent commit(s)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   Seeing other's changes reduces probability of conflicts and duplication of effort. 
   Updating to the most recent version is good preparation for working offline.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be easier not to have to learn all these new commands.
It would be very difficult to keep trakc of which file is what, and when, why,
and by who changes were made.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It is better to make experimental or controversial changes in a separate brach so
that the master branch is an accepted working copy.
