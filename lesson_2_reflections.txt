Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. Git creates a sub-directory and all the files it will use to track committs.


Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A. The staging area contains files that have been selected from the working directory
in preparation for adding to the repository.  The staging area allows files to be
added as a group instead of individually.  To have a new committ for each logical change
may require committing more than one file at a time, but not all the files in a project.
The staging area allows selection of only the necessary files.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
